  <p>We are fortunate to have craftsmen from Thanjavur Mr. Shankaran J, Mr. Kumar and Mr.Kadhirvel who had spent their valuable time for us to understand the nuances of our heritage craft. Tacit knowledge transfer is a 5-day workshop on <span style="color:#db4689;">detailed demonstration from the artisans </span>on the why and wherefore of art plate design principles. It was all started with the discussion on art plate and its making techniques for the students to have a basic knowledge. </p>
  <p>A contemporary art plate design from kural studio team was shown from the scratch and students gets to explore the different stages involved in making of art plate. Also, research team was engaged with utmost dedication and came to know <span style="color:#db4689;">the complications and other struggles faced by the artisans.</span> Tacit knowledge transfer workshop was admittedly useful in developing the power tool by understanding the hand usage and movements on a technical aspect.  </p>
  <p>As the outcome of tacit knowledge transfer, Research team progressed on ergonomically designed furniture by analyzing the work culture and posture of artisans. Conceptual design was then developed and materialized in a best way possible. The team took effort in designing the furniture to attain comfort and to assure <span style="color:#db4689;">healthy work environment for the artisans. </span> Furniture design has gone through its own iterations and the end product was safely delivered to artisans. Now the developed furniture was used in artisan's workplace in a full bloom.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom:30px; color:#6a6c6d;">3-day hands on workshop on acoustical treatment using ethnic fibers</p>
<p>Hands on acoustic workshop on acoustical treatment using ethnic fibers was conducted on 1st of march 2021. Third year students of Rajalakshmi school of architecture & other interested professionals played a main part in making the workshop a success. After <span style="color:#db4689;">experimenting with pattamadai mat as an acoustical treatment,</span> Kural research team delivered their research output to the students for them to have wider knowledge on acoustical property of natural materials.  </p>
<p>Not only the acoustical property of pattamadai mat was explained, Dr Kalaiselvi has given a lecture on <span style="color:#db4689;">making process of acoustic wall panel with ethnic fiber.</span> Fabrication of wall panels and fixing process of same were demonstrated by the assigned workers. Students were got to explore more on structural and technical details of acoustic wall paneling </p>
<p>For more involvement of students, a design task was introduced to develop a wall panel design using ethnic fiber and the brainstorming session was conducted next day to discuss more on <span style="color:#db4689;">design development and acoustical design </span>of a space. Some students were involved in fabric paneling on site with the help of workers.  </p>
<p>As for the ceiling treatment, students pitched in their ideas on ceiling panel design. Kural team came up with <span style="color:#db4689;">acoustical ceiling clouds using pattamadai mat </span>as a technical intervention and the design was an output from exploring rhino & grasshopper software. Even though the research team has finalized design on ceiling treatment there are some challenges faced during execution. Students & designers get to explore more on site and had fun in completing the ceiling treatment too. </p>

  <p>3-day Hands on furniture making workshop was held on 01.03.2021. A workshop to demonstrate the making process of furniture was explained to the 2nd & 3rd year students of Rajalakshmi school of architecture. The main aim of the workshop is to give students a wide knowledge on <span style="color:#db4689;">ergonomic measurements involved, details of materials & finishing techniques. </span>Research team has worked on field with the workers to bring out the best product they’ve designed. </p>

With the hands on from the student Nandhini who is very keen on working on the field, sat with the workers and completed the product without much help. They also made even more interactive by taking photographs of said floor cushion with student as a model and thus adds a wonderful memory to our gallery.</p>
  <p>Other furniture which was designed for particular work group was also explained to the students and they get to watch the <span style="color:#db4689;">prototype development from the scratch. </span>Furniture making workshop is a huge success which helps in delivering the furniture to artisans' workplace on time </p>

    <p style="color:#6a6c6d;">Online lecture on ergonomic design development of furniture</p>
    <p>Designing Furniture has been advanced from the Traditional wood-based furniture to the Modern 3D printed furniture. But the term <span style="color:#db4689;">Ergonomics has lost its integrity </span>in the field. To hike productivity of a healthy environment, Ergonomic furniture design is a vital demand. We integrated this Workshop with Hands On session besides online lectures & standards as it ends up with a conceptual design development from students.</p>
    <p>Understanding of <span style="color:#db4689;">“why furniture designing plays a major role”</span> is the main vision of this online lecture. We conducted this workshop for the 1st & 2nd year students as they’re the future designers, it is mandatory for them to know the importance of furniture designing. Workshop lecture was started with overall view on furniture design and why furniture designing is outspoken a lot in architecture field. Ar. Gauri S Lal has given a lecture on the said topic in a best way for better understanding. A fun activity was given to the students and their involvement in design learning made the workshop much more interesting. A design which was submitted by the students were also good and the team get to develop new furniture to add it in their catalogue. </p>

Asmaa H which was very helpful for the students in conceptual development stages of design. Brainstorming session by Dr.Kalaiselvi is also included to explain about <span style="color:#db4689;">the informal work sector and their work culture.</span> Followed with furniture design development for artisans with respect to their culture was presented by Ar.Rakhshana to give a wider knowledge on design process of furniture making. Students get to know the different work cultures of Tamilnadu and the challenges faced during fabrication is also explained. </p>
    <p>Workshop concluded with discussion session on the conceptual design developed by the students. Many interesting ideas came into spotlight and students explored more on <span style="color:#db4689;">conceptualizing a furniture</span> design which was the ultimate goal of the workshop.</p>
